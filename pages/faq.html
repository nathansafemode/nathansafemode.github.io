                        It takes a month to fully edit the video. This may seem long but it ensures us the quality that we can give.

                        We are the ones who pick the music. In this we can avoid copyright issues and we can ensure that the video will match the music.

                        It is not strictly 15 mins, it's just the average time we can tell. It all depends on what will happen on the event.

                        I think it is that we treat our clients more like friends, and that gives you the assurance that we are doing our best.

                        We learn how to appreciate even the smallest detail of an event. We learned how to appreciate others moment and treasure them as ours. And we learn that if we do that, clients tend to be more vulnerable to us and would love to share they're moments with us.
